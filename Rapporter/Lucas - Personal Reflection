What do I want to learn or understand better?

After Fridays lecture I’ve gained a better understanding about SCRUM, but there is still a lot to learn. The LEGO-exercise also helped a lot but reading further articles would create a better understanding. One main thing to understand is the actual project, but more information will come next Wednesday.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

By gaining knowledge on my own I can share that knowledge within the group. For example, finding useable information about aspects that will be needed in the project. Since the course is in an early stage it is difficult to provide help. 

What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?

By adding information to the Github-page and trying to learn about different tools for using SCRUM. Since we have not really implemented scrum yet the contribution does not have to be high at this stage

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

First week of the course, meaning no objectives have been set from last week. Until next week I would have like to:
•	Learn more about SCRUM
•	Gained insight about the project and start to work on that
•	Improve my non-existing skills on Github
