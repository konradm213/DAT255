What do I want to learn or understand better?

The introduction to the project gave me insight on what is expected by the project. Despite the introduction I still need to deepen my knowledge about the PortCDM-platform and some coding regarding it. Also, keep gaining knowledge about Scrum.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
This is an important step during the early stage of the project, so everybody in the team is on the same page and no one gets left behind. By sharing the essential knowledge that I’m gaining within the group I will make sure that we all are on the same page. 
What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?

To be able to implement scrum and sprints fully we need to establish a team-backlog with our expectations and requests. After Easter this will be a priority. This week I have thought about how scrum should be implemented into the project in an efficient way and also shared my thoughts. 

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? That means that for the personal learning objective you will each week write down what you have achieved in relation to last week's ambition (technologies, concepts and skills learnt as well as how this was achieved), what you would like to achieve for the next week and how to make the change happen. The first week of the course you describe the current situation by motivating a learning objective. It is perfectly fine to change objective/s each week as long as you can motivate the change and you evaluate the outcome of the previous week (e.g. describing the current situation).
Last week's goals:
•	Learn more about SCRUM 
•	Gained insight about the project and start to work on that
•	Improve my non-existing skills on Github

The majority of the goals from last week have been achieved, thought I would like to learn more about the actual project and scrum (backlogs etc.).

For next week:
•	Improve Scrum-knowledge
•	Learn more about the project
