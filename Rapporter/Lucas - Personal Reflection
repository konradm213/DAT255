What do I want to learn or understand better?

Where I am: After being introduced to the project and having time off during Easter I’ve been able to deepen my knowledge about the project and Scrum. I’ve also had time to download and learn about PortCDM.

Where I want to be: After a while, with the help of my fellow group members, I’ve managed to set up the IDE in Android Studio. Though I want to improve my knowledge on coding in general and Exponent. I also want to fully understand every function of the existing app.

How to get there: After the meeting with the product owner I will hopefully have enough information to start coding, until then I will learn the features of the app and read literature about the scenario etc. 

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Where I am: After reading a bunch of relatable literature I’ve gained a lot of knowledge that I’ve shared when needed within the group. 

Where I want to be: Keep gaining new knowledge by reading literature and doing related exercises. Then sharing that knowledge to make sure that we all are on the same page, working as a unit. 

How to get there: If I feel like someone in the group does not understand a certain thing, I make sure that we do not move on until we all are on the same page. 


What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?

Where I am: I contributed by helping to set up the Trello board and write some of our user stories etc. 

Where I want to be: Contribute as much as possible to extend and work on our user stories and sharing knowledge about the application and so on. 

How to get there: Now when our Trello is set up and a meeting with the product owner has been scheduled I will make sure to gather as much information as possible from him and help to extend our Trello board.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
Where I am: 

Last week the goals:
•	Improve Scrum-knowledge
•	Learn more about the project

The goals from last week will still stand, since they are long term goals. Though I will add some new goals for next week. This week/sprint I’ve learned more about the project and more about how PortCDM works. We’ve set up a Trello-board as an implementation of Scrum.

Where I want to be:

For next week:
•	Gather information from the product owner
•	Start the coding process
•	Set up appropriate user stories on Trello


How to get there: 

By attending the meeting with the product owner and listen carefully, also ask appropriate questions if needed. After that I could start to think about how I can contribute by coding and adding user stories.
