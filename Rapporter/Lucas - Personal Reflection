What do I want to learn or understand better?

Where I am: This week I’ve started working on a user story together with Konrad. I’ve learned more about the code and app, so I know where to make the changes to complete the user story. During the coding-process I’ve learned more about JavaScript in general since I’ve never used it before. 

Where I want to be: Keep improving my knowledge about JavaScript and the different parts of the code of the app.

How to get there: Continue at the same pace and work together with my group members to gain more knowledge. 

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Where I am: After improving my knowledge about the code and Github by getting help from group members and reading online (Slack etc.), I’ve (and other group members) come to a certain point where we can efficiently share knowledge and help each other so that we can come up with good solutions.

Where I want to be: Our, and my main priority, is to keep up the pace and finish our contributed user stories.

How to get there: Keep helping other group members with their user stories if they get stuck or are uncertain of some things.


What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?

Where I am: This week we went through our time-estimates with the product owners and Jan-Philip so that we could know how to improve them for the upcoming week. 

Where I want to be: Help the team to have correct time estimates and contribute the user stories in an efficient way. 

How to get there: Attend all meetings we set up and finish my given user story. Find out the velocities of the different team members so that we can make correct estimates.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
Where I am: 

From last week:
•	Finish my user story
•	Learn more about JavaScript and share knowledge 
•	Attend all meetings

Me and Konrad almost finished our user story, we put in a lot of time and had some minor difficulties in the beginning, but we took our time to be able to understand the code fully. All other goals from last week was fulfilled. 

Where I want to be:

For next week:
•	Finish my user story
•	Learn more about JavaScript and share knowledge 
•	Attend all meetings

Same goals from last week will stand. 

How to get there: 

Put in the work that’s needed (20h) and keep up the pace. Work closely with my team members.
