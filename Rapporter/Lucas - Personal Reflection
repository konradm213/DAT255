What do I want to learn or understand better?

Where I am: This week I’ve built the project and downloaded everything that was needed. My programming environment is basically set up, though I have some minor issues with the exp. Next week we will start the coding process.

Where I want to be: I want to learn more about agile development in general and Scrum. Also make sure my programming environment is working fully so I can contribute and help coding. On Monday we will meet with the product owner and ask some relatable questions. 

How to get there: First attend all the meetings and “handledningstillfällen” to get useful information. After meeting with the product owner/terminal guy to develop our user stories (if needed), I can start coding. 

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Where I am: After setting up the programming environment in Android Studio and building the project (took a while), I’ve gained some knowledge. I’ve also studied the app and its functions closely, something I can share with the team.

Where I want to be: Keep gaining new knowledge by reading literature and doing related exercises. Then sharing that knowledge to make sure that we all are on the same page, working as a unit. 

How to get there: By attending as much as possible to collect information needed for the project. Found the “handledningstillfällen” to be very useful in that case.

What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?

Where I am: I helped develop and refine the user stories after we met with the products owners on Wednesday. Also read about agile practices and Scrum. 

Where I want to be: Contribute as much as possible in our current situation. This week it felt like we got somewhere; getting the codebase working and arranging a meeting with the terminal guy. After the meeting with him we will get some useful information to start coding. 

How to get there: Keep sharing information and helping within the group. Develop the user stories and maybe add some after our meeting on Monday.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
Where I am: 

Last week the goals:
•	Gather information from the product owner
•	Start the coding process
•	Set up appropriate user stories on Trello
Most of the goals from last week was achieved. Though the product owner took over a week to answer so we were not able to arrange a meeting when we wanted, thankfully it is sorted now. I helped develop and set up appropriate user stories on Trello and discussed them with the product owners. 

Where I want to be:

For next week:
•	Start the coding process
•	Meet with the terminal guy
•	Attend all important meetings


How to get there: 

Solve my minor issue with the exp not running properly. Gather as much information as possible from the terminal guy and start working on the user stories we set up.
