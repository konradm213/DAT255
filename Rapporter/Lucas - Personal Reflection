What do I want to learn or understand better?

Where I am: 

This week me, and the other team members have prioritized the bachelor thesis and spent a little less time on the project. Me and Konrad finished our user story after some minor issues that Pontus helped us with. I’ve learned more about the code and app, so I know where to make the changes to complete the user story. During the coding-process I’ve learned more about JavaScript. 

Where I want to be: 

Keep improving my knowledge about JavaScript and the different parts of the code of the app. 

How to get there: 

Continue at the same pace and work together with my group members to gain more knowledge. Ask Pontus, Jan-Philip and product owners to gain more knowledge and make our work more efficient.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Where I am: 

At this late stage in the course I feel like I’ve gained enough knowledge about Github, Scrum and agile practices. I’ve (and other group members) come to a certain point where we can efficiently share knowledge and help each other so that we can come up with good solutions.

Where I want to be: 

Be able to help team members and allocate time to pairs that are stuck on their user story or task. Share my knowledge efficiently.

How to get there: 

Keep helping other group members with their user stories if they get stuck or are uncertain of some things. Work closely with my pair-programming partner and combine our knowledge.

What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?

Where I am: 

After discussing with Jan-Philip, we realized some user stories could be divided into smaller tasks, so that team members that is stuck on their user story or done, still can contribute. We also went through our time-estimates with the product owners, to be able to make small improvements for the upcoming week. I did my best to help with that.

Where I want to be: 

Get a better understanding about how to work efficiently with user stories and time-estimations. 

How to get there: 

Keep attending meetings to be there to discuss the user stories and time-estimations with Jan-Philip and the product owners. By analyzing and finding out the different velocities within the team I can help make better estimations.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
Where I am: 

From last week:
•	Finish my user story
•	Learn more about JavaScript and share knowledge 
•	Attend all meetings

After getting some help from Pontus we finished the last part of our user story which we had some minor issues with. I attended all meetings and helped with the group reflection and provided help to the other team members with their user stories when needed.  

Where I want to be:

For next week:
•	Choose a relevant user story and finish it, finish smaller tasks if I get stuck.
•	Learn more about JavaScript and share knowledge 
•	Attend all meetings

How to get there: 

Put in the work that’s needed (20h) and keep a steady velocity. Work closely with my partner in pair-programming and other team members.
