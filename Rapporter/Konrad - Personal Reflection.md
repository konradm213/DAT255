# Week 1

what do I want to learn or understand better?
Currently I have a mediocre understanding of SCRUM, and I want to learn and understand it better although I feel like the LEGO-lab was helpful. Until next week I will read the articles from Emil. I would also like to understand the project we are supposed to do, but I guess I’ll have to wait until wednesday to find out more.

how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Not really sure how I can help someone else at this point, since we are just starting out and we are at the same level of knowledge about SCRUM and the rest of the project. I would like to be able to help them later on though and will do it by getting an even better understanding of SCRUM.

what is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
I set up the Github repository together with with everyone else. We also took a look at different tools for SCRUM. Next time I want to contribute even more and will do it by being even more prepared before out meeting.

what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? That means that for the personal learning objective you will each week write down what you have achieved in relation to last week's ambition (technologies, concepts and skills learnt as well as how this was achieved), what you would like to achieve for the next week and how to make the change happen. The first week of the course you describe the current situation by motivating a learning objective. It is perfectly fine to change objective/s each week as long as you can motivate the change and you evaluate the outcome of the previous week (e.g. describing the current situation).
I had no learning goal from last week, since we just started, but will set one up now. I want to learn more about Github, especially what branches are and will do it by googling. I would also like to get better insight into the project we are about to perform, but I will wait until wednesday for that.

# Week 2

what do I want to learn or understand better?
Right now I have a very shallow understanding of the problem we are supposed to solve and the current codebase. I want to understand the codebase we are working with better, meaning the whole PortableCDM repo and all components used for it along with our specific case, the Terminals point of view. I will do this by reading through some of the code and reading the scenario.

how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I feel like no one really has a good grasp of the project at this moment. So, the best thing I could do for the team would be what I wrote above; to understand the problem and codebase we will be working with better, so I can assist in explaining it to my team. I wrote above how this will be done.

what is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
Since we still haven’t had the chance to meet with our client and therefore haven’t been able to establish a backlog, we haven’t really started to apply scrum fully. Our scrum backlog has no items in it either and everyone is just trying to learn about Github, the project and so on, so we do not have any structured team-backlog for this week, we will have one for next week (two weeks actually since it is easter) though when the project “actually” starts. We do have the reflection of our processes at the end of the week though, which is still kind of weak, since we are just learning stuff and not actually coding. We are starting to discuss roles and so forth in the team thought. Next week we want to have clear roles and a clear backlog and will do it by discussing our strengths and weaknesses internally as well as meeting with the client (assuming we already have a good understanding of the project).

It is perfectly fine to change objective/s each week as long as you can motivate the change and you evaluate the outcome of the previous week (e.g. describing the current situation).
Last week I wrote down learning Git as my objective along with getting a better insight into the project. I feel like I understand Git and Github well enough right now, but do not feel like the lecture this wednesday was enough for me to understand the whole project. My goal and path to the goal for next week is exactly the same as in the first answer furthest up on the page.

# Week 3

What do I want to learn or understand better?

Where I am: Since last week I got a better understanding of the whole PortableCDM codebase. We still haven’t met the product owner so I still don’t have his perspective on the app. 
Where I want to be: After getting the IDE to work finally I realize I need to get better at coding in JavaScript and learning Exponent. I also need to see how it integrates with Android Studio which I’m familiar with since earlier. Also have a good understanding of the terminals point of view.
How to get there: First we will meet with the product owner, and later I will learn the whole environment by simply starting to code and googling when I’m stuck (or getting help from someone else). From past experience that has been the quickest way for me to learn stuff.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

Where I am: I think that I’m the only one who has successfully set up the environment currently, so I will be able to help whoever needs help with that.
Where I want to be: I want to be able to help out whoever needs help with understanding the whole PortableCDM environment, Exponent and JavaScript.
How to get there: Same answer as in the first question.

What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?

Where I am: I helped write the preliminary user stories together with the team, and also helped with setting up a shared Trello board. 
Where I want to be: Next week will be the first proper sprint and therefore the scrum part will be more important than earlier. I want to makes sure to be able to attend all meetings and so forth.
How to get there: Just keep doing the same as last week.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? 

Where I am: I helped in creating the user stories from the scenario available on the course website. I also got the programming environment to work on my laptop, and will help those who need it next week. Both of these made me achieve last weeks goal.
Where I want to be: I want to be able to get as many user stories done as possible. Also to refine the current ones we have after talking to our contact person at the terminal.
How to get there: I will do this by attending the meeting next week and making sure to know as much as I can about the environment and the interactions before we actually start with the coding.
