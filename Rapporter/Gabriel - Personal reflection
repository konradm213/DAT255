Weekly reflection, week 3

What do I want to learn or understand better?

Where I am: During the last two weeks I read “Scrum and XP from the Trenches - 2nd Edition.”, “Breaking a feature into tasks” and “Maintaining the full view of a complex system” which really helped me understand more about scrum.
I also read a bit in the book “Pro Git” which helped me understand more about what Git is, why it is so useful and how branching/merging works.
Lastly I read the scenario that described how the harbour worked although it still is a bit confusing.
Where I want to be: I still want even more knowledge about agile processes (not only scrum) and Git. This week I also realized that I will have to learn a lot about Android Studios. Once I have enough knowledge within these three things I hope to be able to be an effective team member that can contribute towards the project and understand what others are doing as well. I am also looking forward to our first meeting with the contact person to understand more about our project.
How to get there: There is still a lot of literature about agile, git and Marine IT that I haven’t read but me goal is to eventually come around to read everything that I think seems interesting/useful. In order to understand how to use Android Studios I will have do some research myself and ask other team members.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

Where I am: I found “Scrum and XP from the Trenches” really handy so I decided to write a summary which a shared with the others in my team, hopefully they will find it useful. Now when somebody has a question about scrum I feel like I am often able to give them an answer. 
Where I want to be: For next week I will hopefully have Android Studios set up and ready to go, this will allow me to help my team by actually being able to code! :) When I have the time to read more literature I will try to share the knowledge with my team.
How to get there: From what I have heard from others, it seems a bit difficult to set up Android Studios but hopefully with some blood, sweat and tears I’ll manage by next week. I will obviously help others in doing the same if I can and ask for help when I need to.

What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?

Where I am: I was this week elected as the team’s Scrum Master. I find scrum really interesting and I am looking forward to helping my team follow the framework. Today we also created a team on Trello and I helped in configuring the different boards I giving my thoughts on how we should use Trellos functions. I also gave some thoughts on how to slice and formulate user stories when we wrote some down (though a lot of them will probably change by the time we actually have our first spring with coding).
Where I want to be: I hope on being a good Scrum Master and managing to incorporate the most important scrum tools to our team in an effective way and making sure the other team members also understand how to use Scrum and find it meaningful.
How to get there: Reading more literature about Scrum and taking notes of what I think we should incorporate in our team.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? 

Where I am: Hopefully as Scrum Master I will be able to indirectly facilitate the delivery of the product as intended by the contact owner. Unfortunately we haven’t talked with the contact person yet and I haven’t gotten android studio to work on my computer yet so I haven’t been able to contribute with any actual code though.
Where I want to be: For next week, I want everyone to have a computer ready for coding a productive meeting with the contact person so we can write some good first user stories so that we can have a first real Sprint Meeting.
How to get there: Feel like this has already been mentioned.
