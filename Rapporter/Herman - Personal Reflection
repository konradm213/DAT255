what do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to learn JavaScript, Expo and React Native to grasp how these parts operate together to build the app we are working on.
I also want to understand the terminal station better and will be able to do that next week when we visit the terminal.

how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I know some things about android studio now so I can contribute with that, although we will have to learn some other programs.

what is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
So far I've participated in exercises and lectures. I'm planning on reading up on scrum to be able to identify my role.

what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I've put down a lot of time to get the app running and been able to help the others.
