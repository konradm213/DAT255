what do I want to learn or understand better?
As I've not come much further since last week much of that still stands, as to learn more about scrum, IT project processes and mobile
applications. As we have now been introduced to the project I wish to get to know the marine industry better, where the are
technically and what the potential is for improvement. 

how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
By getting clear understanding of everyone's knowledge we as a team can help each other. I can then demonstrate and explain what I know 
if there's need for others to know too. Furthermore I as part of the team will keep my eyes and ears open to catch up on new things
to learn.

what is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
I am confident in that it will get clearer what is needed and what everyone's contribution will be when we 
start with the project. Therefore I look forward to get started as these first two weeks mostly have been introduction and preparation.
To work on something more concrete will probably make it easier to define what my contribution will be. As of now I've participated in 
lectures and exercises to learn how to apply scrum to the project.

what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
As we have just gotten the project our contributions are mostly knowledge in this state. I've learned a bit about Android Studio and
acquired more insight in Git and GitHub. By constantly staying up-to-date with lectures and litterature as well as expanding my 
knowledge I think I will be able to make significant contributions.
