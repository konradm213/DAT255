what do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to learn JavaScript, Expo and React Native to grasp how these parts operate together to build the app we are working on.

how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
As we will not work in Android Studio I will have to figure out other ways to contribute. 

what is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
So far I've participated in exercises and lectures. I've read some literature and will apply that now once we have started with the project.

what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I've put down a lot of time to get the app running and been able to help the others. Now the app runs and I've started looking at the code. 
Communication with the involved parties is important which I try to take part in.
