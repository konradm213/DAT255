what do I want to learn or understand better?
Much the same as last week. To learn more about scrum, IT project processes and mobile
applications. As we have now been introduced to the project I wish to get to know the marine industry better, where the are
technically and what the potential is for improvement. As we have gotten new directions in what environment we will program in 
I want to get familiar with that.

how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I know some things about android studio now so I can contribute with that, although we will have to learn some other programs.
By keeping an eye out I, partly, can help the team stay organized to encourage learning.

what is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
So far I've participated in exercises and lectures. I'm planning on reading up on scrum to be able to identify my role.

what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
We will see a bit more once we meet our contact person. Until then I'm active in meetings and stay up-to-date on material.
