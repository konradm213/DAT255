what do I want to learn or understand better?
Now: I've learnt a bit about JavaScript and how Expo and React Native operate to build an app. I also know how the code is structured in
the app which have help during the programming.
Goal: I still want to understand how the application in the emulator updates automatically. 
How: By asking other students and Pontus at Rise Victoria. 

how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Now: It is hard to specify but we help each other out in a lot of ways. As soon as someone learns something new they share it with the 
rest of the group and I try to do the same. The pair-programming have helped us getting to know different aspects of the application.
Goal: My goal is to continue doing what I am doing but backed up with some more knowledge about JavaScript. 
How: I will get more effective in my work and focus more when we work together.

what is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
Now: In order to be effective in our work I am involved in our meetings and reflect on previous sprints so that the next one
may be better. I have talked to the product owners when we needed to ask something as well as in group talking to Jan-Philipp about the 
work process.
Goal: I want to get better at reviewing and reflecting over past sprints. We have a lot to learn from earlier in the project and we need
to take action to improve the final sprints. As the project is approaching an end we need to try to gather all knowledge we've gained
to finish the last sprint in the best way possible.
How: Trying to steer the group meetings towards reviews and reflections before we continue planning the coming sprint.

what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
Now: The app is running and initial changes have been made to test that it works. I participate in our discussions about the backlogs and
their content. Also I've been coding with Gabriel as we've split up into pair-programming. As the bachelor's thesis took a great portion of
this week's hours I have to compensate for that next week. 
Goal: To write good code effektively and maintain contact with the product owners, terminal guy and the other terminal group.
How: At this stage I've just to keep going!
