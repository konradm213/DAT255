Weekly reflection - Gabriel

What do I want to learn or understand better?
I’m keen to learn more about SCRUM. At the moment i only have a vague picture of what it is but it seems like a powerful tool in order to work effectively as a team. I also want to learn more about how Github works.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Since the course just started and I haven’t been able to participate in the lectures I think I first have to get to position where I have a deeper understanding of the course and its content before I can help someone else.

What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
None so far, but I am committed to fully adopt the technique in order to make the entire project easier and more manageable for my team members as well as for myself. 

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? 
During the next week I want to learn what the project’s about, how to properly use Github and a bit more about what SCRUM is.
