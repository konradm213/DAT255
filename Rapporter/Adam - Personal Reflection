What do I want to learn or understand better?
As scrum is a new approach to working on projects for us, the main focus during the early
phase of the course will be to familiarize ourselves with what it entails. At this stage, it’s
difficult to specify any other goals, as this week has been mostly about introduction to the
subject at hand. Once actual work has been started on the actual task, specifying clear weekly
learning goals will become easier.
How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
As mentioned above, work at this point consists mostly of familiarizing oneself with the
scrum approach. The group will work together in ensuring that each member develops a
reasonable level of understanding, thus enabling everyone to contribute to the finished
product.
What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
Once I’ve become more familiar with the details, I’ll be able to answer this more
appropriately. For now, it’s as mentioned all about developing a stable base of understanding.
What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
Ensuring that I fulfil my end of the social contract put forth by the group, by going through
this week’s slides and participating in the building game – thus bringing me up to speed on
the ideas presented.
