What do I want to learn or understand better?
With the project introduced, I’m mostly focused on understanding the logistics and mechanics of how a harbour operates. Being well-informed on how the problem situation works is key in developing an application that actually causes improvement to the system.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
The whole group is more or less working on the same thing – knowledge building – at the moment. Therefore, cooperation is mostly about ensuring everyone is on the same page and caught up with the status of the project. My part in this will be the same as everyone else’s – helping out if anyone is having trouble grasping parts of the discussion.

What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
As with last week, it’s difficult to concretely specify this part just yet, as the project up until this point has been all about studying literature to grasp the project as a whole. This question will come more into play as the project is split up into separate tasks.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I believe I’ve lived up to my promise from last week by studying scrum to better understand the mechanics of it. Until next report, it’s all about continuing to study as much as possible, regarding the problem situation and harbour logistics.
