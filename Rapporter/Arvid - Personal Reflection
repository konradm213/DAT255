what do I want to learn or understand better?
Now:  I want to understand exactly how the app code is connected to the app features. Right now I feel pretty lost when coding and it’s mostly a process of trial and error. Regarding last weeks goal: I now understand much better how a sprint works.
Goal: To understand how the code works and how to properly rewrite it to achieve my sprint goals
What to do: Sit down for an extended amount of time and walk through the code step by step. Consult with my sprint-teammate on which code snippets we should edit to achieve our sprint goals.

how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Now: We still have some struggles with getting things like github up and running, but at least we know it works for me and Konrad. We’re helping our teammates get up and running as well but disseminating knowledge between everyone is not always easy since everyone is on different levels and are available at different times.
Goal: Get everyone acclimated to the the code and how to rewrite it
What to do: Sit down with the team, not only my sprint partner, and try to explain the parts of the app where I have an insight that they don’t have. Try to explain which modules do what etc.

what is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
Now: I’ve been dividing user stories into tasks. I now realize that we probably won’t be able to complete a whole user story, but at least we can finish some tasks that make up the user story.
Goal: To help my team members to divide their user stories into tasks that are reasonably doable with our time constraints.
What to do: Talk with my team and suggest some tasks for every user story.

what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? That means that for the personal learning objective you will each week write down what you have achieved in relation to last week's ambition (technologies, concepts and skills learnt as well as how this was achieved), what you would like to achieve for the next week and how to make the change happen. The first week of the course you describe the current situation by motivating a learning objective. It is perfectly fine to change objective/s each week as long as you can motivate the change and you evaluate the outcome of the previous week (e.g. describing the current situation).
Now: I have completed last weeks goal, since I now know how to use user stories in an effective way. Now that I am more familiar with the code, and it’s complexity, I can now better formulate user stories that are reachable.
Goal: My new goal is complete at least one task within my assigned user story for this sprint.
What to do: I will sit down a little bit each day and get better acquainted with the code. Thereafter I will try to achieve my task by changing the code little by little and make heavy use of trial and error.
