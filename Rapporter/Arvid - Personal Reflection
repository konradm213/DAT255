what do I want to learn or understand better?
I would like to understand how PortableCDM works and the exact specifications of our assignment. I would also like to know how the repository is designed. Right now it’s quite unclear exacty what we are supposed to do. I would also like to understand exactly what is expected of us in terms of code quality etc. More specifically, I want to know what requirements the terminal operator has for the app. I plan on learning this by reading the course info and studying the reading through the scenario and the code.

how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I can help my team by distributing the information we’ve been given, and sharing my views on it. I will also be able to help my team further as my knowledge of the project grows.

what is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
We haven’t yet started using scrum in our practice, but we have set up a git repository, and plan on using the Github scrum interface. We have a clear goal of starting our use of scrum in two weeks.

what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? That means that for the personal learning objective you will each week write down what you have achieved in relation to last week's ambition (technologies, concepts and skills learnt as well as how this was achieved), what you would like to achieve for the next week and how to make the change happen. The first week of the course you describe the current situation by motivating a learning objective. It is perfectly fine to change objective/s each week as long as you can motivate the change and you evaluate the outcome of the previous week (e.g. describing the current situation).

Learning objective: to understand the use of scrum in practice better. 
Not much has changed since I set up my learning goal last week.This is because we have yet to start using scrum in practice, since we haven’t started actually working on the project. The way to reach my learning objective is to wait until we start working with the project and have some actual user stories to work with.
