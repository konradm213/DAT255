what do I want to learn or understand better?
Right now I don’t quite understand the effective use of user stories and the terminal workers needs. I want to understand how to write user stories in an effective way, and how to assign a priority in an effective way. I also want to learn more about our user (the terminal worker) and his/her needs when it comes to the app. I plan on improving my knowledge by contacting the terminal worker, and learning about his specific needs and then convert them into user stories.

how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I help my team by informing them of the project status as we go along. I want my team to have the same information as I do. I can further help my team by distributing the information we’ve been given, and sharing my views on it. I will also be able to help my team further as my knowledge of the project grows.

what is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
We have started formulating user stories. I have helped my team by writing several of the user stories. Of course we haven’t yet met the terminal worker so we aren’t sure if all of our user stories will be applicable to his specific situation. I want to be in a situation where we have all necessary user stories formulated. I plan on reaching this situation by interviewing the terminal worker and exploring his needs.

what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? That means that for the personal learning objective you will each week write down what you have achieved in relation to last week's ambition (technologies, concepts and skills learnt as well as how this was achieved), what you would like to achieve for the next week and how to make the change happen. The first week of the course you describe the current situation by motivating a learning objective. It is perfectly fine to change objective/s each week as long as you can motivate the change and you evaluate the outcome of the previous week (e.g. describing the current situation).
Learning objective: To learn how to use user stories in an effective way

Last week I wanted to learn how to use scrum in practice. I now have a slightly better insight into how to formulate the user stories now, but I still haven’t had a chance to use the user stories in sprint. This week I’ve formulated the learning objective of learning how to use user stories in an effective way. I want to learn exactly what criteria should be used for moving a user story from in progress to done etc. I plan on reaching this goal by studying the use of user stories in practice.
