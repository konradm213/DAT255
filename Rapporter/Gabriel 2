Weekly reflection - Gabriel

What do I want to learn or understand better?
We have just been introduced to the project but there is still a lot that is unclear. This week I would like to get a deeper understanding of what our task is and what PortableCDM is. I also still have to learn more about SCRUM and Github.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
My goal is to read more of the course literature and then perhaps recommend the articles that I found the most useful/interesting to other team members who haven’t read them.

What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
I have started to read the book “Scrum and XP from the Trenches” and it has really helped me understand how to use the Scrum framework. By understanding more about Scrum I hope to be able to give some suggestions on how to plan our project.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? 
We still haven’t started with the project so I haven’t contributed in any way directly related to the project. Still primarily focused on learning myself.
