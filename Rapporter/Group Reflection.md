# WEEKLY REFLECTION, WEEK 1

 **The chosen scope of the application under development including priority of features and for whom you are creating value**

In this stage we haven't been introduced to the project. We wish to be able to clearly define the scope of the application, including priority of features and definition of the user we are creating value for. The first step in order to do this would be to attend the introduction lecture on wednesday next week. Here we will gain useful insights in the upcoming project, as well as a scope of the application to be created. 

**Your social contract, which means you should create one in the first week**

This week we wrote our social contract. We wish to adhere to the details in the contract. We will do this by creating a very friendly group dynamic. 

**The success criteria for the team in terms of what you want to achieve with your application**

At this stage we haven’t been introduced to the project. Our success criteria will be based on the project specification, thus this is a part of our weekly reflection that will be further explained in the upcoming weeks.

**Your acceptance tests, such as how they were performed and with whom**

At this stage we haven’t been introduced to the project and don’t know what acceptance tests are. We would like to know what acceptance tests are. We will do this by googling, reading course literature and attending lectures.

**The design of your application (choice of APIs, architecture patterns etc)**

At this stage we haven’t been introduced to the project yet. The design is an important aspect, meaning we will put a lot of time to achieve a design with high standard.

**The behavioural overview of your application (for instance through use cases, interaction diagrams or similar)**

At this stage we haven’t been introduced to the project. When we know more about the project we will be able to set up some specifications, therefore we want to know more. To do this we will participate at the lecture about the project in order to get to know the assignment. 

**The structural overview of your application (such as class diagrams, domain models or component diagrams)**

At this stage we haven’t been introduced to the project. When we have a good grasp on the project we will make detailed class diagrams. We will to this by drawing on knowledge from previous courses.

**Your user stories in terms of using a standard pattern, acceptance criteria, task breakdown and effort estimation**

At this stage we haven’t been introduced to the project. When we know more about the assignment we can break it down in order to plan the project. So, we will wait for the project introduction and go from there.

**The three KPIs you use for monitoring your progress**

At this stage we haven’t been introduced to the project. This means that it will be hard to determine which KPI’s that will be appropriate. Our goal is to determine three reasonable KPI’s that will probably change during the weeks. To get there we need to learn about the project and literature to be able to determine the KPI’s.

**Code quality using a tool such as Findbugs (1 point if your code includes issues concerning correctness or bad style, 2 points if you have dodgy or performance issues and 3 points if the code is fine), only asses the code you have written yourself**

At this stage we haven’t been introduced to the project and we are not familiar with Findbugs or any similar tool. As such, at least our code doesn’t contain any bugs, wihoo! Our goal is to get to know these tools and learn how to use them. To do this we will browse what alternatives there are and be all ears during the lectures.

**The roles you have used within the team**

Since the project has not started yet it is hard to distribute roles within the group. Having eight people working on the same project we would save a lot of time and increase efficiency if we distribute clear roles. Our objective is to distribute clear roles. 

**The agile practices you have used for the current sprint**

This week we’ve been introduced to scrum as a technique. For the coming weeks we wish to get to know other practices which are appropriate to use. Hopefully the coming lectures and exercises will give some insight as to where we are heading. 

**The time you have spent on the course (so keep track of your hours so you can describe the current situation)**

We’ve spent 15 hours on the course during this week. Our goal is to put in 20 hours a week with some flexibility from week to week. To achieve this we are going to create an excel document where we can put down our hours worked each day. Also, when we get to know the project it will be easier to schedule our time. 

**The sprint review (either in terms of outcome of the current week's exercise or meeting the product owner)**

During the Lego exercise we realized the importance of sprint reviews. Although we assume that the sprint reviews during the actual project will be of a different character The sprint review was important in order to adjust the work tempo.

**Test practices for using new tools and technologies (IDEs, version control, scrum boards etc.)**

Version control - Git
Scrum - Github
We would like to adopt the industry standards, and we will do it by researching on google and through course literature.

**Relation to literature and guest lectures (how do your reflections relate to what others have to say?)**

We haven’t yet had any guest lectures or literature reviews. In the future we would like to be able to relate them to our work. We will do this by attending the lectures.



# WEEKLY REFLECTION, WEEK 2

The chosen scope of the application under development including priority of features and for whom you are creating value
As of now, we don’t have a fully clarified scope of the application yet. However, what we do have is a specified client that we will work together with. In our case, the client functions as a terminal. In other words, our client is responsible for handling vessels both departing and arriving. Today, we don’t have a contact person assigned and therefore we have not made a priority of features, as we are not aware of the prefered values and features that the client is expecting from the application. In the introduction to the project, we were told to create a user story on our own. This, we will finish after Easter, when we have processed the project and its scope a bit more, thus being more full-fledged when creating the user story.

**Your social contract, which means you should create one in the first week**

Last week we wrote our social contract. We wish to adhere to the details in the contract. We will do this by creating a very friendly group dynamic, as stated in our contract. 
As of this week, we have not yet encountered any difficulties regarding the group dynamics etc. Therefore, the social contract remains the same as last week’s. However, if the group starts to perform worse when the actual project and coding begins, we will be inclined to change and develop the contract with that in mind. Thus, it is something to keep in mind, that if the circumstances alters and the social contract needs to be furthered developed, the social contract is a tool to improve the dynamics of the group. Also, the social contract will work as an incentive for everyone to do their respective work and not to break the contract. Hopefully, we will not encounter this.

**The success criteria for the team in terms of what you want to achieve with your application**

We have as of now been introduced to the project, but we still don’t know about the specifications, other than that it should satisfy the terminal operators demands. As we have yet to be introduced to the terminal operators demands, we don’t have any success criteria. The way forward is to meet with the terminal operator and ask him for his specifications as well as the technical specifications required by the PortableCDM framework.

**Your acceptance tests, such as how they were performed and with whom**

We have been introduced to the project, although we haven’t started working with it yet. We have therefore not yet formulated any acceptance tests.

**The design of your application (choice of APIs, architecture patterns etc)**

Now we have been introduced to the project in a lecture explaining an overview of the problem and some information about what our purpose is. The fact that Easter is approaching and that we haven’t been introduced to our contact person made it difficult for us to start the process of planning the application. Our ambition for the week after the break is to meet our contact person and get familiar with the options we have. Until then we will dig into some of the litterature and read the scenario in the GitHub repository.

**The behavioural overview of your application (for instance through use cases, interaction diagrams or similar)**

Kind of the same as the previous topic. At this moment we know a bit about what the application as a whole should be able to do. However we don’t know specifics concerning expected behaviour and demands. Our intentions are to map the suggested and wanted functions and pair these with the proper behaviour. To move forward with this we will study the subject and the scenario so that we are prepared to meet our contact person and get the most out of our first meeting.

**The structural overview of your application (such as class diagrams, domain models or component diagrams)**

At this stage we have been introduced to the project. At the moment it seems very unclear in what our task is. We are supposed to meet with our “customers” the week after the easter break. Hopefully things will become clearer at that point, but for now, we do not have a clear enough view to design any class diagrams, domain models, or component diagrams.

**Your user stories in terms of using a standard pattern, acceptance criteria, task breakdown and effort estimation**

At this stage we have been introduced to the project. However, we are only meeting our “customers” the week after the easter break, which means that user stories for now seem to be quite a fruitless pursuit, since we don’t know our task or goal. Therefore, we will wait until our meeting with the customer, and hopefully after that things will become clearer in regards to this topic.

**The three KPIs you use for monitoring your progress**

We got introduced to the project this week but we still haven’t had the chance to get acquainted with the codebase we will be working with or the client we will be working for. We have been reading course literature though and have since identified two potential KPIs, one of which we can already start using. The first one is individual hours per week spent on the project and the other would be a burndown-chart of our backlog. The goal is to put in an average of 20 hours per week during the course period and keep the burndown-chart line as straight as possible, once we have established a backlog. For next week we want to have our third KPI ready and reach our goals with the other two (one for this week, since we haven’t started coding yet). The amount of hours spent is currently tracked in a shared excel file. We will find our third KPI by reading the literature, but we do think it will become much clearer when we know what we actually are going to do for this project.

**Code quality using a tool such as Findbugs (1 point if your code includes issues concerning correctness or bad style, 2 points if you have dodgy or performance issues and 3 points if the code is fine), only asses the code you have written yourself**

Very similar to last week. We still haven’t started coding so we still don’t have any bugs to find. We have determined Findbugs to be a viable alternative though and will be using it once we start coding. Our goal is to have as few bugs as possible in the coming week, when the project actually starts. We will do this by carefully planning and finding the optimal high-level solutions before we start coding.

**The roles you have used within the team**

Since last week we have talked about implementing and distributing different roles. The project has been introduced briefly and roles will help the working process and increase the working efficiency. Right after the easter break we will talk about the distribution of different roles.

**The agile practices you have used for the current sprint**

Last week we got introduced to Scrum as a technique, which will be our main agile methodology. Some practices were mentioned in the lectures (XP etc.), and for the next coming weeks we would like to find out which of those practices that are appropriate to use.  

**The time you have spent on the course (so keep track of your hours so you can describe the current situation)**

Once again, we’ve dedicated around 15h to the course during this week. As the project is still in its starting tracks, it’s only logical that the full 20h recommendation is not fulfilled. When the actual development and implementation begins, more resources will likely be required to stay on schedule.

**The sprint review (either in terms of outcome of the current week's exercise or meeting the product owner)**

This week, some working time has been spent attending the two lectures given in relation to the course - with the purpose of increasing the base knowledge for the project. In addition, the mechanics of how a harbour operates has been researched, as well as further work on understanding how to optimally utilize Scrum.
best practices for using new tools and technologies (IDEs, version control, scrum boards etc.)

According to “Scrum and XP from the Trenches” a good way to manage the backlog is using a shared google sheets. Therefore we have created one in our drive that we can later start using, though until we have our first backlog refinement/sprint meeting we’re not really going to use it. Apart from that nothing has really changed from last week.

**Relation to literature and guest lectures (how do your reflections relate to what others have to say?)**

We still haven’t had any guest lectures or literature reviews so we can not reflect on them. However what we can do is the literature on the course-website ourselves to prepare ourselves for the guest lectures and that way be able discuss/reflect on the differences we find. Once we learn more about the project we will also start reflecting on how it relates to the literature we have read.

# WEEKLY REFLECTION, WEEK 3

 **The chosen scope of the application under development including priority of features and for whom you are creating value**

Now: This week, connecting with last week’s goals, we developed user stories for the terminal, as the terminal is our client for this project. We used the Trello website in order to create these with a good overview and with easy access for everyone. Due to the fact that we haven’t met Mikael, our contact at terminal, we are not able to connect our own user stories with those of his specifications. For the prioritization, right now, we have made the prioritization following the order of the instructions made in the scenario on Github. Therefore, we will probably change the prioritization for each individual user story.
Goal: For next week, we want to meet up with Mikael and connect our user stories with his own perspectives of what is important in the development of the application. Here, we will gain useful insights for further development, and also beneficial perspectives to be used together with the scenario.
What to do: In order to complete our goal for next week, we will have a meeting with Mikael and come as prepared as we can, to ask relevant questions and to understand his specifications more fully. 

**Your social contract, which means you should create one in the first week**

Now: The social contract remains the same, as the one we created in the first week. We wish to adhere to the details in the contract. We will do this by creating a very friendly group dynamic, as stated in our contract. We have not yet encountered any difficulties regarding the group dynamics, as of now.  
Goal: We wish to add the individual roles of all the team members in the social contract. This we be useful to for each member in order to remember their respective roles and the responsibilities that comes with each role.
What to do: Just a simple update in our contract, with regard to the goal stated above.

**The success criteria for the team in terms of what you want to achieve with your application**

Now: Our success criteria is to make the terminal worker satisfied with the app.
Goal: We want to adjust our success criteria to make it more specific.
What to do: Talk with the terminal worker and hear more specifically what it will take to make him satisfied with the app.

**Your acceptance tests, such as how they were performed and with whom**

Now: We have no acceptance tests as of now.
Goal: Formulate an acceptance test for each user story.
What to do: Learn about the specific needs from the terminal worker. Edit our user stories to make them more specific so that we can properly formulate acceptance tests for each one of them.

**The design of your application (choice of APIs, architecture patterns etc)**

Now: After reading some litterature we know some more about the scenario and what is expected. Thus we have written some user stories as far as our knowledge reaches. Unfortunately we did not get an answer from our contact person in time to organize a meeting.
Goal: As we haven’t yet had the opportunity to meet our contact person we hope to do that as soon as possible. Then we can double check our user stories and get a better picture of the project.
What to do: Set up a meeting with our contact person. 

**The behavioural overview of your application (for instance through use cases, interaction diagrams or similar)**

Now: We have set up a few user stories. Currently we are also setting up the development area to get things running.
Goal: The goal is to talk to our contact person and in collaboration state the functions of the app.
What to do: The next step is as above to get a meeting with our contact person.

**The structural overview of your application (such as class diagrams, domain models or component diagrams)**

At this stage we have been introduced to the project, but we have not yet met our client. At the moment it seems very unclear in what our task is, other than the basic application demo and code we received last week. We were supposed to meet with our client the week after the easter break, but this will apparently be postponed until next week. Hopefully things will become clearer at that point, but for now, we do not have a clear enough view to design any class diagrams, domain models, or component diagrams.

**Your user stories in terms of using a standard pattern, acceptance criteria, task breakdown and effort estimation**

At this stage we have been introduced to the project, but we have not yet met our client. However, we are only meeting our clients next week, which means that user stories for now seem to be quite a fruitless pursuit, since we don’t know our task or goal. Therefore, we will wait until our meeting with the client, and hopefully by that point things will become clearer in regards to this topic.

**The three KPIs you use for monitoring your progress**

Now: Since last week, we have refined our KPIs. The burndown-chart was scratched since it has been difficult to maintain one, without any user stories. Also, it would be too time consuming to keep one up to date in the later stages. The 3 current KPIs are:
Communication - Although not very measurable, it is critical to our success in our project. The ability to be clear and keep everyone up to date, both internally in the team and externally, will let everyone see the progress which is being made and the individual contributions. We have also just recently contacted the product owner (terminal 1) for the first time.
Estimation Accuracy - How accurate we are with our estimates of the user stories. This is critical since we have removed the burndown-chart. It also allows us to know exactly how much we can do each sprint and therefore also during the whole project. This metric is very useful, especially together with the next one.
Velocity Consistency - Making sure we work 20 hours every week was replaced by this metric (mostly just a fancy name for the same thing). This metric, together with the previous, will once again allow us to be able to tell the product owner how much we can accomplish during every week and also the whole project.
Goal: The communication inside of the team has been alright so the focus in on good communication with the product owner. For the other two metrics, it is difficult to tell since we haven’t had the chance to actually use the user stories we created yet. Judging on how deceptively long time it took to get the environment up and running it will be difficult to get correct estimates.
What to do: Book our first meeting with the product owner and establish a good communication channel. Start working on the user stories next week and see how well we are estimating the times. Also make sure to aim for 20 hour per week.

**Code quality using a tool such as Findbugs (1 point if your code includes issues concerning correctness or bad style, 2 points if you have dodgy or performance issues and 3 points if the code is fine), only asses the code you have written yourself**

Now: Still haven’t written any lines of code, although we thought we would by this time in last weeks reflection.
Goal: Write good code.
What to do: Same as we wrote last week, we will do this by carefully planning and finding the optimal high-level solutions before we start coding, but also through checking each other's code.

**The roles you have used within the team**

Now: As of now, we started to contribute some roles within the team. Gabriel was assigned the role of Scrummaster and Emil was decided to be the contact person of the group.
Goal: To assign more clear roles within the near future to aid our working process. 
What to do: As we get further into the project new roles will appear and our goal is to distribute them in a fair and proper way.

**The agile practices you have used for the current sprint**

Now: The current main agile practice that is being used is still Scrum and will be throughout the project. Scrum is the framework we use to implement agile development. This week we set up a board on Trello to be able to apply Scrum.
Goal: Learn more about Scrum and improve our board on Trello. XP is something that was mentioned as an agile practice, maybe there is a way to implement it later.
What to do: Read articles to improve our knowledge about agile development and Scrum. Try to find out if any more agile practices can be implemented into our project. 

**The time you have spent on the course (so keep track of your hours so you can describe the current situation)**

Now: We’ve kept on schedule and dedicated approximately the planned 20h per person and week. 
Goal: To continue working along the same lines as we currently are in the following weeks, maintaining the scheduled level of work. 
What to do: Stick to the schedule in order to avoid pushing work ahead.

**The sprint review (either in terms of outcome of the current week's exercise or meeting the product owner)**

Now: The preliminary user stories have been successfully set up through Trello, but will be refined after the meeting with the product owner. In addition, the first attempts to use the programming software have been made - although so far, there have been problems with getting it to function properly. 
Goal: Next week will be the first proper sprint, so the goal is to finish all user stories for that week, and later do another review of the week. So getting a more complete understanding of the problems and getting to work on the programming.
What to do: Meet up with the client. Understand how to properly use the development toolkit. 

**Test practices for using new tools and technologies (IDEs, version control, scrum boards etc.)**

Trello
Now: We have set up a Trello team where we have a created board with our Product Backlog, in other words we have decided not to use google sheet for the product backlog like we said two weeks ago. 
Goal: We also plan on creating a board for each sprint in the future. Trello will be the main tool in which our team remains coordinated and follows the scrum framework. Some of our internal communication will also be held in Trello though will also keep using our Facebook Messenger group.
What to do: The trello features we haven’t used yet that will help us reach our goals are:
Checklists in each user story with criterias (such as the ones in our definition of done) that we use to know when we can move the user story to the next column in the sprint board.
Assigning members to each user story and task so we know who is working on what.
Comments and mentioning members so we can communicate efficiently instead of always using the fb messaging group in order to avoid it getting too cluttered.

**Relation to literature and guest lectures (how do your reflections relate to what others have to say?)**

Guest lectures
Now: During the last guest lecture on Monday we discussed the difference between user stories, tasks and epics, how a sprint board should work, how to manage a product backlog and most importantly how to slice user stories. Most of what was discussed we had already read in the literature and only had to make small adjustments to our scrum but the content regarding how to slice stories was very educational and will be useful for our project in the future.
Goal: Stories should be vertically sliced in way that they are of independent value to the product owner and follow the INVEST criterias while tasks should follow the SMART Criterias.
What to do: Will read a bit more about the INVEST and SMART criterias to make sure we have them in mind when slicing stories.
Also want to note that unfortunately none of us could attend Wednesday exercise in Lindholmen so we can’t comment on that.
